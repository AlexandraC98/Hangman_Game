## Hangman_Game

This is the 39th challenge of 100 Days of Code on Replit.

The script checks each letter from a randomly chosen word and displays specific messages for both correct and wrong choices, as well as ascii art for the hangman.

I have chosen to display a more colourful output to make the game a bit more engaging.
